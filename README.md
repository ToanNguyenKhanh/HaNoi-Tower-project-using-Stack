This project implements the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using a stack data structure in C#. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

    Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack i.e., a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
    No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Files Included:

    Program.cs: This file contains the main implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem using a stack data structure. It includes the necessary functions to solve the problem recursively.

    Stack.cs: This file contains the definition of the Stack class, which is used to implement the stack data structure.

    README.md: This readme file provides information about the project, its purpose, and how to use it.

Acknowledgments:

This project was inspired by the classic Tower of Hanoi problem and the concept of using stacks to solve it. Special thanks to the developers and contributors of the C# language and .NET framework for providing the foundation for implementing the stack data structure in C#.
